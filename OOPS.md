# What is OOPS ?

# CLASS:

A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.  It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. In general, class declarations can include these components, in order:

    Modifiers : A class can be public or has default access.
    
    Class name: The name should begin with a initial letter (capitalized by convention).
    
    Superclass(if any): The name of the class’s parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.
    
    Interfaces(if any): A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.
    
    Body: The class body surrounded by braces, { }.

# OBJECT:

An object is an instance of a class.Technically, Class is a template which describes what state and behavior of an instance this class can have. Object implements the state and behavior in the form of variables and methods and requires some memory allocated.An object consists of:

    State : It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
    
    Behavior : It is represented by methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.
    
    Identity : It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.

# 🚀 Advantages of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects". It offers several advantages that make software design more modular, flexible, and maintainable.

---

## ✅ 1. **Modularity**
- Code is organized into classes and objects.
- Each class is a separate module, which makes code easier to understand and manage.

---

## 🔄 2. **Reusability**
- Through **Inheritance**, one class can inherit features from another.
- Code can be reused instead of being rewritten.

---

## 🔒 3. **Encapsulation**
- Data (attributes) and methods (functions) are bundled together.
- Access to internal data is restricted and controlled via access modifiers.
- Improves security and reduces system complexity.

---

## 🔁 4. **Polymorphism**
- The same operation can behave differently on different classes.
- Increases flexibility by allowing objects of different types to be treated as instances of the same class through interfaces or parent classes.

---

## 🧬 5. **Abstraction**
- Hides complex implementation details and shows only essential features.
- Simplifies the interface of complex systems.

---

## 🔧 6. **Easy Maintenance and Upgrades**
- Changes in one part of the system can be made independently of other parts.
- Makes debugging and testing easier.

---

## 🧠 7. **Improved Productivity**
- OOP encourages code reuse and clean design, which reduces development time.
- Enhances team collaboration due to better structure and readability.

---

## 👥 8. **Real-World Modeling**
- Objects in OOP represent real-world entities.
- Makes system desig
