# CLASS:

A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.  It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. In general, class declarations can include these components, in order:

    Modifiers : A class can be public or has default access.
    
    Class name: The name should begin with a initial letter (capitalized by convention).
    
    Superclass(if any): The name of the classâ€™s parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.
    
    Interfaces(if any): A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.
    
    Body: The class body surrounded by braces, { }.

# OBJECT:

An object is an instance of a class.Technically, Class is a template which describes what state and behavior of an instance this class can have. Object implements the state and behavior in the form of variables and methods and requires some memory allocated.An object consists of:

    State : It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
    
    Behavior : It is represented by methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.
    
    Identity : It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.
